# Discord Guidelines:

## Be Nice. Be Respectful.
We cannot stress enough that we want this to be a safe, comfortable and inclusive environment. Please read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/DotzInc/debussy_concert/wiki/Code-of-Conduct) if you need more information on this guideline.

## Keep timezones in mind and be respectful of people's time.

As of today, the core Debussy team is based solely in Brasil, but the community is targeted world wide.

If you post in off hours be patient, someone will get back to you once the sun comes up.

## Asking for help

- Do your best to try and solve the problem first as your efforts will help us more easily answer the question.
- Head over to our [Wiki](https://github.com/DotzInc/debussy_concert/wiki)
- Checkout [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/DotzInc/debussy_concert/discussions) this is where we want most of our problem solving, discussion, and updates to go because it helps keep a more visible record for Debussy users.

## Promoting Products or Services
Debussy is a piece of the puzzle when it comes to being a data practitioner and so we want our community to be aware of the other pieces that make up the whole picture. If you plan on sharing an awesome tool or service you have no association with jump into #tools_and_services. If you are promoting your own please abide by the following rules.

1. You're allowed to;
    1. Promote your tool ONLY in #tool-and-service or when you introduce yourself in #introductions.
    2. Promote your tool in the tools channel once. Beyond answering questions about the tool multiple postings may be viewed as excessive and receive a warning.
    3. Mention your tool if someone mentions or is organic to a solution.
2. If you see a partnership opportunity with Debussy please DM @Lawrence Fernandes#3444 and @Nilten#2847. We would love to create collaborative content and work with you if possible in promoting your product/service.
3. We will warn you if your promotion becomes excessive or not aligned with our code of conduct. If continued the result could end in you being removed from the discord community.
4. **No Soliciting. Do not cold DM our users to promote your product. If we receive a valid soliciting complaint about you, we will remove you from the community.
5. Have any questions about our promotional rules or want to run what you plan to share by us? DM @Lawrence Fernandes#3444.
